*List Of Machine Learning Libraries:

----->*NumPy*:-   
                 It is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical 
                 functions to operate on these arrays.

------->*SciPy*:-
          It is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, 
        interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.

------->*Scikit-learn*:- It is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. It is on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib, this library contains a lot of effiecient tools for 
machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

-------->*Theano*:- It is a Python library and optimizing compiler for manipulating and evaluating mathematical expressions, especially matrix-valued ones. In Theano, computations are expressed 
using a NumPy-esque syntax and compiled to run efficiently on either CPU or GPU architectures.

-------->*TensorFlow*:- it is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for 
machine learning applications such as neural networks.

--------->*Keras*:- It is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to
 enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible

---------->*PyTorch*:- It is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily 
developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.

--------->*Pandas*:- Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for
 manipulating numerical tables and time series.

-------->*Matplotlib*:- It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into
 applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.
